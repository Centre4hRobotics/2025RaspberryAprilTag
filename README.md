# 2025RaspberryAprilTag
This repository holds the source code for the Raspberry Pi-based AprilTag system for CC4H Robotics. Visit [learn.cc4hrobotics.org/programming/raspberry-pi](https://learn.cc4hrobotics.org/programming/raspberry-pi/) for background information and tutorials.

Each different camera, meaning each camera with a different sensor or lens, should get its own profile in `config/CameraProfiles.json`.
Each camera should have its own entry in `config/Constants.json`

## Calibrating

Run `manual_camera.py` to take pictures of a ChArUco board. It publishes the current image it can see to network tables, but you need to use the command line for actually taking the image. Then, run `calibrate.py` (in `calibration/`) to generate a camera profile. It does not include framerate or rotation, so you'll need to add that too.
> Both of these require the virtual environment generated by `setup.sh`
